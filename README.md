# myTODO Sample #

---

myTODO is a sample application to manage and share simple lists, for example tasks to complete, favorite movies, books you enjoyed, and so on. With full list management, you can cross off items, give them due dates, add, and remove items through a rich HTML 5, mobile-friendly interface.

The sample was built using [ASP.NET MVC 4](http://www.asp.net/mvc/mvc4), [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and [Windows Azure SQL Databases](https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/home/features/data-management/) for the underlying data store. It also exposes public lists through HTTP services using [ASP.NET Web API](http://www.asp.net/web-api).  This sample demonstrates the following:

- How to use Windows Azure SQL Databases with a Windows Azure Web Site
- How to deploy a Windows Azure Web Site with Web Deploy
- How to build and run mobile web sites on Windows Azure
